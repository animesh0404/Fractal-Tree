# Fractal-Tree
A simple fractal Tree.


This is simple fractal tree created in p5.js, I've learned from this youtube channel CodingTrain(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU&t=240s)
this is my personal take on this project.


## Chek it out on your browser have some fun playing with it:

## Usage:

(X-Axis) - Moving mouse horizontally across the screen will expand the Tree.

(Y-Axis) - Moving mouse vertically across the screen with increase/decrease height of tree.

### For best experience view it on a Desktop/Laptop.
